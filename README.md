## 👨‍💻 About Me
I design, build, and operate production systems with an emphasis on automation, reliability, and developer experience. I blend software engineering and platform skills to deliver scalable services and smooth developer workflows.

- 🔭 Focus: infrastructure automation, CI/CD, platform reliability, and integrating LLM/AI tools into developer tooling  
- 🌱 Learning: practical LLM/AI toolchains and applying them to automation & developer experience  
- 👯 Open to: collaboration on platform tooling, observability, automation, and AI-assisted developer tools  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to bake cookies — I bring the same patience and experimentation to ops as to baking!

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build and operate cloud-native platforms (infrastructure as code, automated pipelines)  
- Design CI/CD and developer workflows (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)  
- Containerize and orchestrate workloads
- Develop backend and frontend services with a focus on maintainability and testability  
- Explore ways LLMs can improve DX (documentation generation, automation scripts, smart CI checks)
